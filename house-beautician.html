<h2>What Does a House Beautician Do?</h2>

<p>
A house beautician focuses on improving existing spaces by enhancing layout,
lighting, finishes, and materials rather than rebuilding the entire house.

This service often includes repainting, feature wall design, lighting upgrades,
minor carpentry works, and layout adjustments that improve functionality and aesthetics.
